Targets

DB: name yogahonc_consultingg8, user yogahonc_consultingg88 (password will be set in cPanel; do not print it).

Output: a minimal deploy.zip and a README_DEPLOY.md with exact steps.

Tasks

Production build & packaging

Build React → dist/ for SPA.

Backend: composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader.

Produce deployable structure:

public/
  index.html + assets (from dist)
  backend/api/ (PHP API + vendor)
  uploads/        (empty but present; writable after deploy)


Add .htaccess rules for SPA routing and /backend/api (no directory listing).

Exclude dev artifacts (node_modules, logs, caches, tests).

Create deploy.zip with only production files.

Environment templates

Create .env.production.example with:

APP_ENV=production
APP_URL=https://<your-domain>
DB_DRIVER=pgsql
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_DATABASE=yogahonc_consultingg8
DB_USERNAME=yogahonc_consultingg88
DB_PASSWORD=<set-in-cpanel>
JWT_SECRET=<set-in-cpanel>


Ensure backend reads env vars; no secrets in repo.

Database dump (from Replit)

Generate a timestamped Postgres dump from current $DATABASE_URL:
dump_YYYYMMDD_HHMM.sql (UTF-8, schema+data).

Place it in _deploy/ (outside public/) and include in deploy.zip.

Also output the exact import commands for SuperHosting (phpPgAdmin steps and psql equivalent).

Server requirements & permissions

Document required PHP extensions: pdo_pgsql, pgsql, fileinfo, mbstring, intl, gd (or ImageMagick), exif, curl, openssl, zip, opcache.

Recommend php.ini options: upload_max_filesize=20M, post_max_size=20M, memory_limit=256M, date.timezone=Europe/Sofia.

Note: set public/uploads permissions (755/775) after extract.

Post-deploy verification (automate & print results)

/backend/api/health → JSON OK + DB connected.

Admin login works (JWT).

Create property → folder /uploads/properties/<prop-###>/ created.

Image upload/delete and PDF upload/open/delete work; URLs return correct MIME.

Year built: 1800–2040 rule; clearing → NULL and hidden.

Featured toggle persists; admin pagination (10/page) works.

All responses are strict JSON; no HTML leakage; proper status codes.

Deliverables

Path to deploy.zip.

README_DEPLOY.md with step-by-step for SuperHosting:

Set PHP 8.2 + extensions in cPanel.

Create DB yogahonc_consultingg8 and user yogahonc_consultingg88 (set password in cPanel).

Upload and extract deploy.zip into public_html/.

Import _deploy/dump_*.sql via phpPgAdmin (or psql).

Add env vars (DB creds, JWT_SECRET, APP_URL) in cPanel.

Make public/uploads writable.

Run the verification checklist above.

Do not print any real passwords; use placeholders and instructions to set them in cPanel.
